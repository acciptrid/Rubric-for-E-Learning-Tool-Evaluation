# Rubric for eLearning Tool Evaluation

This rubric has been designed for instructors and staff as a formative tool to evaluate eLearning tools in higher education. eLearning tools
are defined as any digital technology, mediated through the use of a computing device, deliberately selected to support student learning.
The rubric supports a multi-dimensional evaluation of functional, technical, and pedagogical aspects of eLearning Tools.

## Instructions

Not all rubric criteria are necessarily applicable to all eLearning tools and those using the rubric are encouraged to assess irrelevant criterion as “not
applicable”. The rubric does not identify a discrete threshold that an eLearning tool needs to cross before a tool should be used; the rubric is a formative
tool intended to offer insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses of an eLearning Tool, as evaluated against a set of criteria.
